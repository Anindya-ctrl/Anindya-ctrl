Hey there, I'm Anindya. I'm an aspiring software engineer who is perpetually astonished and intrigued by the world of technology. I've primarily worked on full-stack web development but at the time of writing this, I'm exploring the world of DSA and shifting toward the path of competitive programming. I'm also a fellow desktop linux enthusiast and a passionate windows hater.
